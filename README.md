#dynsys

This library contains a collection of utility classes and functions for basic dynamical system 
modeling tasks (such as computing a parameter maps, cobweb (aka Verhulst) diagrams or basins of attraction).

Computations are accelerated using [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl). PyQt4-based UI elements are provided for displaying
and interacting with data. 

Warning for potential users! Only kind of "documentation" currently available is (poorly commented) examples, 
located under the "examples/" directory. There are plans on writing full-featured documentation across project,
but these are in the not-so-near-future.
